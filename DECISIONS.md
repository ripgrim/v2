# DECISIONS

Append-only log of choices made where the spec left a gap. New dependencies and
any deviation from the §3 layout MUST be recorded here (see AGENTS.md anti-BS
block). Newest at the bottom of each section.

---

## Dependencies

Everything in spec §2 is pre-approved stack and needs no entry. Recorded below
are only additions or version pins that warranted a call.

- **zod `^4`** — the validation layer is locked by §2; v4 chosen (latest major,
  matches the pre-installed `.agents/skills/zod` guidance). `@tripwire/contracts`
  is the only package that depends on it directly.
- **ultracite `^7` + biome `2.4.5`** — inherited verbatim from the redesign
  demo's lint setup (`biome.json` extends `ultracite/biome/react`). Hoisted to
  the root as the single Biome config (§2). Not a new choice; the demo's.
- **`@types/bun`** — dev-only, so `bun test` / `Bun` globals typecheck at the
  root. No runtime footprint.
- No other dependencies added. Package graph is workspace-internal only.

## Layout / structure

- **`apps/mcp` is agents.md-only.** Spec §3 says "Do not scaffold beyond an empty
  folder + agents.md"; the build-step note about stubbing "every app" is
  reconciled in the spec's favour (spec wins). No `package.json`/`tsconfig`/`src`
  there — so it is not a workspace member yet, exactly as intended.
- **Workspace dependency arrows are declared in each `package.json`** even where
  `src/index.ts` is still an empty stub, so the installed graph matches §3 from
  commit one ("structure is documentation"). `scripts/check-boundaries.ts`
  enforces the arrows against actual source imports.
- **`apps/web` keeps the demo's own `tsconfig.json`** (not extending
  `tsconfig.base.json`). The base adds `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, which would
  spray unrelated errors across the ported demo; retrofitting that strictness is
  out of scope for step 1. New packages extend the base and get the stricter flag.
- **`apps/web` retains its `#/*` imports field and Vite/TanStack toolchain**
  unchanged. Only the lint/typecheck wiring and the type source (now
  `@tripwire/contracts`) changed.

## Contracts organisation

- **Contracts mirror the demo's mock-data domains, not §4's file names.** §4
  lists `events.ts / runs.ts / rules.ts / review.ts / repo.ts / workflow.ts` —
  those describe BACKEND shapes that do not exist in the demo yet. §4 also states
  the governing rule: "Extracted from the redesign demo's mock data — the demo's
  shapes ARE the contract." Inventing backend schemas now would violate both that
  and the anti-BS block. So step 1 ships the demo's actual domains:
  `moderation.ts, automod.ts, log.ts, contributor.ts, integrations.ts,
  repo-analytics.ts, repo-content.ts`. The §4 backend files land as the build
  steps that produce their shapes arrive (events → step 3/4, runs/rules → step
  5/6, review → step 9, workflow → step 6/10).
- **Demo `src/lib/*.types.ts` files are now thin re-exports** of the inferred
  contract types, so every `#/lib/*.types` importer is typechecked against the
  contract with zero component churn.
- **`DitherColor` moved into contracts** (`repo-analytics.ts`) because
  `RepoMetric.color` is part of a data shape. `dither-chart.tsx` now imports and
  re-exports it. The separate vendored `dither-kit/palette.ts` keeps its own
  identically-named union — it is a self-contained UI kit, not a data contract.

## Schema shapes flagged for hand review (§ "the one thing I review by hand")

Extraction is faithful to the demo: TypeScript `?` → `.optional()`, `| null` →
`.nullable()`. The tri-state / ambiguity calls Grim should sanity-check:

- **Nullable-but-required (present, may be `null`)** — modeled `.nullable()`:
  - `FlaggedItem.reporter` (null ⇒ came from automod, not a person)
  - `LogEntry.moderator` (null ⇒ pure automod action)
  - `ContributorDetails.location`
- **Optional (key may be absent)** — modeled `.optional()`:
  - `FlaggedItem.automodRule` (present only on automod-sourced items — note the
    asymmetry with `reporter`: one is nullable, the other optional, mirroring the
    demo exactly. Worth confirming both are intended.)
  - `CaughtBy.reporter`, `Comment.flag`, `ThreadDetail.branch` / `baseBranch`
  - `RepoMetric.delta` / `invertDelta` / `sub` / `suffix`
  - `ThreadAnalytics.flagged` / `checks` (issues vs PRs surface different ones)
  - `FlaggedComment.commentId`, `CheckOrReview.actor`, `ParticipantCount.flagged`
- **Enums kept CLOSED (`z.enum`)** — every string union in the demo became a
  closed enum. If any of these are expected to grow with real GitHub data,
  loosen deliberately:
  - `ItemType` (issue/pull/comment), `Reason` (spam/harassment/off-topic/automod/
    nsfw), `Severity`, `ModStatus`, `ModerationAction`
  - `RuleCategory`, `RuleAction`, `MatchVerdict`
  - `LogAction`, `LogStatus`, `CaughtKind`, `LogActionKind`
  - `ThreadKind`, `ThreadStatus`, `Visibility`, `DitherColor`
  - `ContributorActivityKind`
  - Inline-literal enums preserved as-is: `GithubAccount.type`
    (Organization/User) & `repoAccess` (all/selected); `FlaggedComment.status`
    (Hidden/Removed) & `CommentFlag.state` (Hidden/Removed);
    `CheckOrReview.kind` (review/check) & `status`
    (Approved/Changes/Passed/Failed).
- **Documented numeric ranges NOT enforced at the schema level (kept
  `z.number()`)** to avoid rejecting valid mock data on a range guess:
  - `AutomodRule.falsePositiveRate` — demo comments "Percentage, 0–100"
  - `ContributionYear.weeks[][]` — demo comments "intensity levels (0–4)"
  - `ModStat.delta` — signed
  Tighten with `.min()/.max()` if you want the schema to police these.
- **String timestamps, not `z.date()`** — every `at` / `*At` field is an ISO
  string in the demo (JSON on the wire). Left as `z.string()`; add
  `.datetime()` if you want format validation.
- **`Record<string, T>` maps preserved** (`RepoContent.issueDetails` /
  `pullDetails`, `RepoAnalytics.threads`) as `z.record(z.string(), …)`.
