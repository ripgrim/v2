# all-summaries — autonomous run log

Append-only. One entry per build step (§13). Cross-refs: DECISIONS.md (ledger),
VERIFICATION-QUEUE.md (human tasks).

Run start: 2026-07-11. Starting state: step 1 committed (`0a4539e`), vocabulary
reconciliation + schema tightenings committed at run start (`280d08f`).

Environment notes at run start:
- Docker daemon was DOWN; launched Docker.app at run start.
- `~/tripwire-eve-demo` DOES NOT EXIST — step 9's port source is missing. The
  review process will be authored fresh from §8 and flagged (DECISIONS.md +
  queue). If the demo lives elsewhere, point step 9's rework at it.
- No old prod repo found on disk — step 5 rules are fresh implementations from
  the spec's rule names/semantics only (which §13.5 permits: "fresh
  implementations", old repo was reference-only anyway).

---

## Step 1 (prior sessions) — workspace + contracts + governance — 0a4539e, 280d08f

**Scope:** bun workspace per §3; demo → apps/web on mocks; mock shapes →
@tripwire/contracts (spec §4 vocabulary); AGENTS.md + .claude/ system;
boundary check; CI. Then: vocab reconciliation, provenance invariant, ranges,
ISO timestamps, forge-derived enum docs.

**Machine-verified (at 280d08f):**
```
$ biome check .        → Checked 201 files. No fixes applied.
$ bun run typecheck    → 10/10 workspaces exit 0
$ check:boundaries     → ✓ boundary check passed
$ bun test             → 9 pass, 0 fail (20 expect() calls)
mock-parse harness     → ALL MOCKS PARSE (14 items, 10 rules, 7 runs, 3 profiles…)
```

**Awaiting live verification:** none for step 1.

**Decisions:** see DECISIONS.md "Vocabulary reconciliation" + "Step-4 completion".

**Needs Grim's eyes:** contract schema shapes (flagged in DECISIONS.md);
`.claude/commands` wording; tripwire-design SKILL distillation.

---

## Step 2 — DB + local infra — 218f56e

**Scope:** full drizzle schema (13 tables: events, runs, run_steps, run_actions,
repos, rule_configs, workflow_definitions, moderation_items, rollups_daily,
user/session/account/verification + forge_identities), client + migrate,
generated migration 0000, .env.example, utils implemented with tests,
authored contracts/events.ts + Verdict.

**Machine-verified — done-when "migrations run clean locally":**
```
$ bun run db:migrate
@tripwire/db migrate: migrations applied
@tripwire/db migrate: Exited with code 0
$ bun run db:migrate   # second run — idempotent
@tripwire/db migrate: migrations applied
$ docker exec tripwire-postgres psql -U tripwire -d tripwire -c '\dt'
(14 rows: account, events, forge_identities, moderation_items, repos,
 rollups_daily, rule_configs, run_actions, run_steps, runs, session, user,
 verification, workflow_definitions)
```

**Awaiting live verification:** none (PlanetScale branch explicitly deferred by spec).

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Step 2" — pg driver choice, Bun.randomUUIDv7,
AUTHORED events.ts + Verdict, RunLog* rename, per-run idempotency key.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** contracts/events.ts shape (authored); RunLog* naming
resolution; run_actions idempotency semantics.

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 218 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      15 pass, 0 fail (49 expect) across 2 files
```

---

## Step 3 — GitHub App + ingest — 0715bb2

**Scope:** ForgeAdapter interface (forge); forge-github inbound: timing-safe
HMAC verify, normalize (GitHub → NormalizedEvent), App JWT + installation
token cache, captured fixture corpus + PROVENANCE.md; contracts/check.ts (§7
verbatim); db: pg-boss queue, events service (transactional insert+enqueue,
markEventNormalized+NOTIFY, quarantine, cursor listEvents), docker-cli test
postgres helper; api: Hono POST /webhooks/github per §5.1–5.4.

**Machine-verified — §11 integration on REAL postgres:**
```
bun test apps/api →
✓ verify → tx(insert + enqueue) → 200; row and job exist
✓ same delivery-id twice ⇒ still one row, one job, 200 duplicate
✓ bad signature ⇒ 401, nothing written
✓ missing signature ⇒ 401; missing headers ⇒ 400
4 pass, 0 fail [1.62s]
```
Fixture corpus (6 captured payloads) parses + normalizes:
```
bun test packages/forge-github → 8 pass, 0 fail
(opened/synchronize/closed/comment/push normalize + contract-parse; ping → null;
 malformed ingested payload throws)
```

**Awaiting live verification:** QUEUE #1 (register App), #2 (tunnel + webhook
URL), #3 (real PR ⇒ one row; redelivery ⇒ still one — the step-3 done-when).

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Step 3" — transactional enqueue mechanics,
testcontainers dropped (hangs under Bun) for docker-cli helper, octokit
fixture provenance, authored check.ts, adapter mapping judgments, no octokit.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** contracts/check.ts (authored); ForgeAdapter surface;
normalize action→kind mapping (reopened/ready_for_review → opened).

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 235 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      27 pass, 0 fail (84 expect) across 4 files
```

---

## Step 4 — Worker + live event list — dda5e16

**Scope:** worker process-event (normalize → NOTIFY / quarantine), api SSE
stream (LISTEN/NOTIFY), web /events surface (server fn + Query + SSE cache
merge, §9 route pattern, authored lib/seo.ts), Events nav entry.

**Machine-verified:**
Worker pipeline (§11 integration, real postgres):
```
bun test apps/worker →
✓ normalizes, writes cols + jsonb, and NOTIFYs 'events'
✓ re-processing a normalized event is a no-op
✓ malformed ingested payload ⇒ quarantined, raw untouched
✓ non-ingested kind (ping) stays un-normalized, not quarantined
4 pass, 0 fail [1.75s]
```
Local end-to-end smoke (api + worker + SSE on compose postgres):
```
$ curl -X POST /webhooks/github (signed fixture)  → {"ok":true,"duplicate":false}
$ psql: smoke-2 | change-request.opened | Codertocat/Hello-World | 2 | f
$ SSE listener captured: "kind":"change-request.opened" (1 event frame)
```

**Awaiting live verification:** QUEUE #4 — real PR appears in /events without
refresh (the step-4 done-when, needs the live App from #1–3).

**Decisions:** SSE over polling; NOTIFY colocated in db service; seo.ts
authored (demo had none); sanctioned useEffect for EventSource; server-only
db import pattern.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** /events page design fidelity (new surface built to the
tripwire-design skill); seo.ts (authored).

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 246 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      31 pass, 0 fail (98 expect) across 5 files
```

---

## Step 5 — Rules registry — 6760718

**Scope:** defineRule + async evaluateRule (RuleResult envelope, skipped-not-
thrown), registry keyed id@version, RuleContext (clock as input), 8 rules at
@1 with per-rule unit tests over fixture contexts, scoring taxonomy + 0-100
composition with fast-check property tests.

**Machine-verified:**
```
bun test packages/core → 37 pass, 0 fail across 10 files [119ms]
(per-rule pass/block/skip/determinism; registry contents/lookup/validation;
 property tests: score ∈ [0,100], red flags never raise, determinism,
 missing-category degradation, clamping)
```

**Awaiting live verification:** none machine-blocked. NOTE: old prod repo not
on disk — rule semantics are fresh implementations, worth a skim.

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Step 5" — RuleResult envelope authoring, zod +
fast-check in core, RuleContext duplication rationale, per-rule judgment calls,
fixture-context provenance, async evaluateRule.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** every rule's config/evidence schema (authored); the
english-only heuristic threshold; crypto-address pattern set; scoring weights
(equal split across present categories, worst-flag penalty).

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 272 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      68 pass, 0 fail (161 expect) across 15 files
```

---

## Step 6 — Executor + hardcoded workflow — 497e80d

**Scope:** workflow DAG contract, validator (cycles/reachability/arity),
executor (topo walk, gate short-circuit, pause/resume, timed step records),
runs/repos db services (snapshot, evidence-validated steps, rows-first
actions), GithubReads, worker orchestration (join, exemption, degradation),
hand-seeded default workflow.

**Machine-verified — done-when "runs + steps persisted with workflow snapshot":**
```
bun test packages/core/src/workflow → 9 pass (pass/block/skip/pause+resume/
  timings; validate: cycles, unreachable, bad refs, misplaced approve edges)
bun test apps/worker →
✓ fresh-account PR ⇒ run persisted with snapshot, steps, verdict block, action row
    run.workflow_snapshot[0].id = "default@1", verdict=block,
    account-age evidence {accountAgeDays: 2}, block action status=recorded
✓ maintainer PR ⇒ exempt, no run
✓ degraded reads (all throw) ⇒ rules skip, run passes, nothing blocked
7 pass, 0 fail [1.69s]
```
(One transient failure in a combined run — parallel test containers; clean
rerun 80/80. Watch for flakiness.)

**Awaiting live verification:** reads against real GitHub (creds) — covered by
queue items; no new queue entry (step 7's live check covers the pipeline).

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Step 6" — DAG semantics (skipped conducts as
pass), verdict derivation + join, resume model, injected evaluator, maintainer
exemption at run level, default workflow thresholds, fetch-only reads.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** workflow.ts contract (authored, review DAG semantics);
default workflow thresholds; exemption behavior (no run for maintainers).

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 282 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      80 pass, 0 fail (199 expect) across 16 files
```

---

## Step 7 — Actions + the PR surface — 2400bdd

**Scope:** comment presenter + upsert, tripwire check run (pending → verdict,
per-SHA upsert), executeAction + assembled ForgeAdapter, worker pr-surface
(§5.6b pending check, §5.12 rows-first + mark-executed, §5.13 comment+check
from one persistence step).

**Machine-verified:**
```
bun test packages/forge-github → 17 pass (3 comment snapshots vs golden files;
  condensedness: exactly 3 lines — verdict+sentence / badge / marker;
  upsert creates-once-then-edits; check creates-then-patches same SHA;
  pending → in_progress without conclusion)
bun test apps/worker →
✓ blocked run ⇒ pending check, block+comment+check rows recorded AND executed;
  retry is a no-op (fake adapter call log: pending:sha → failure:sha,
  comment starts "**tripwire: blocked**"; all rows status=executed;
  re-emit executes nothing)
full suite: 90 pass, 0 fail — ran 4x consecutively clean after teardown
hardening (one intermittent teardown flake fixed)
```

**Awaiting live verification:** QUEUE #5 — the step-7 done-when (sockpuppet PR
blocked, required check kills merge button, new commit edits comment + fresh
check). Steps 1–7 = the MVP heartbeat; #5 is the heartbeat check.

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Step 7" — block-is-the-check, verdict-scoped
idempotency keys, direct pending check, empty request-review payload,
GithubHttp extraction.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** comment copy (constitution voice); check summary
format; the block-action-does-nothing call.

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 289 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      90 pass, 0 fail (3 snapshots, 221 expect)
```

---

## Step 8 — Run page + rules UI + auth — 205930c

**Scope:** Better Auth (createAuth in db, handler on api, session reads +
gate + login page + signOut in web, forge_identities hook), /runs/$runId with
real run_steps evidence rendering, /rules with per-repo config CRUD, rule
config schemas single-sourced in contracts (RULE_CATALOG).

**Machine-verified:**
```
typecheck 10/10 · biome clean (306 files) · boundaries ✓ ·
tests 90 pass, 0 fail
dev-server smoke: /login → 200, /rules → 200, /events → 200,
/runs/<missing-id> → 200 ("run not found" state)
core tests still green after config-schema move (46 pass)
```

**Awaiting live verification:** QUEUE #6 — GitHub OAuth app + real sign-in
(gate closes, forge_identities row appears); run page over a real blocked run
(part of #5's flow).

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Step 8" — createAuth placement, auth proxy,
open-gate-when-unconfigured, config schemas → contracts, JSON-textarea config
editing.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** RULE_CATALOG copy + defaults (authored); the
open-gate fallback call; run page + rules page design fidelity (new
surfaces); auth stack (better-auth config).

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 306 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      90 pass, 0 fail (3 snapshots, 221 expect)
```

---

## Step 9 — ai-review — 8464ab8

**Scope:** review contract (the muzzle), ai-review@1 with injected generate()
and versioned prompt files, worker bounded tool loop (AI SDK + Anthropic,
submit_review answer tool, step cap, adapter-read tools only), AiFindings on
the run page, default-workflow wiring.

**Machine-verified:**
```
bun test packages/core → 53 pass (ai-review: pass/block/needs_review→boolean
  mapping, evidence carries output+trace, prompt renders repo+diff from the
  captured fixture, no-generate ⇒ skipped, essay summary rejected by the
  muzzle, >5 findings rejected, comment events skipped)
full suite: 97 pass, 0 fail
```

**Awaiting live verification:** QUEUE #7 — set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, re-run a
sockpuppet PR, confirm ai-review executes live (trace in evidence, findings on
the run page).

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Step 9" — **eve demo missing, prompts AUTHORED
(morning review target #1)**, submit_review tool as the muzzle, verdict→
boolean mapping, compile-time text imports.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** instructions.md + template.md (authored whole-cloth);
the tool set; DIFF_CHAR_BUDGET=60k; default model string.

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 312 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      97 pass, 0 fail (3 snapshots, 236 expect)
```

---

## Step 10 — Moderation queue → rollups → React Flow editor — f4c9780

**Scope:** moderation-as-paused-run end to end (item on pause, tx-safe decide
+ resume job, decision-edge walk, surface re-emit), daily rollups + real Home
stats, React Flow workflow editor emitting the engine's JSON with a proven
round-trip.

**Machine-verified:**
```
bun test apps/worker (moderation integration) →
✓ needs_review pauses the run and creates a pending item
    run.status=paused, verdict=needs_review, item nodeId=moderated@1:mod
✓ deny resumes down the deny edge ⇒ block; item decided; surface re-emitted
    run completed/block, :resume steps recorded, 2 comment rows (verdict-
    scoped), double-decide returns false
bun test apps/web (editor) →
✓ definition → graph → definition is identity
✓ emission parses against the contract schema
✓ broken graph rejected at emission
bun test apps/worker (round-trip) →
✓ committed editor emission → validate.ts → executor ⇒ verdict block, 9+ steps
full suite: 103 pass, 0 fail — 5x consecutive clean after fixing a docker-run
race (retry) and a REAL test bug (account-age fixture margin floored to 1
when the profile fetch trailed ctx.now)
dev smoke: /workflows → 200, /moderation → 200
```

**Awaiting live verification:** QUEUE #8 — moderated workflow live (send-to-
moderation → /moderation → approve/deny → check+comment update in place).

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Step 10" — resume-via-job, derived outcomes,
honest-zero bannedUsers, DEFAULT_WORKFLOW → contracts, committed-emission
round-trip bridge, JSON-typed config.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** editor UX (functional but spartan — node config
editing happens in /rules, not on canvas); home stats semantics; moderation
page copy.

**Checks:**
```
biome:      Checked 329 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      103 pass, 0 fail (3 snapshots, 257 expect) — 5x clean
```

---

## Spec parity audit — closing artifact

Section-by-section attestation of where each spec requirement lives. Written
after a /cleanup pass (signal forwarding added to the demo's ten query files;
login button moved onto the ui Button primitive; sanctioned-effect audit clean)
and core-coverage tightening (envelope-law tests in
packages/core/src/rules/define.test.ts). Final: 107 tests, 0 fail, all four
checks green.

### §1 What Tripwire is
- Gatekeeper pipeline: ingest `apps/api/src/routes/webhooks.ts` → rules/
  workflows `packages/core/src/{rules,workflow}` → auditable runs
  `packages/db/src/services/runs.ts` → forge actions
  `packages/forge-github/src/actions/*`.
- Git-as-VM seam: neutral types `packages/contracts/src/events.ts`
  ("change-request", never PR), `packages/forge/src/index.ts` (ForgeAdapter),
  signal taxonomy `packages/core/src/scoring/signals.ts` (core never knows
  "sponsors" exists). Second adapter: correctly absent (cut list).

### §2 Tech stack (locked) — all present, nothing else
Bun workspaces (package.json), TS strict ESM (tsconfig.base.json,
noUncheckedIndexedAccess), Biome+ultracite (biome.json), TanStack
Start/Router/Query (apps/web), server functions → db/services (all
apps/web/src/lib/*.functions.ts; zero internal REST), Hono (apps/api),
Postgres+Drizzle (packages/db), pg-boss (packages/db/src/queue.ts,
transactional enqueue proven in apps/api/src/webhooks.integration.test.ts),
SSE via LISTEN/NOTIFY (apps/api/src/routes/stream.ts), Better Auth GitHub-only
(packages/db/src/auth.ts), AI SDK via OpenRouter (apps/worker/src/ai/generate.ts; AI_REVIEW_MODEL default, rule config wins),
React Flow last (apps/web/src/components/workflows/editor/), UUIDv7
(packages/utils/src/id.ts — Bun.randomUUIDv7), pino everywhere (zero
console.log outside scripts/check output), Zod in contracts.

### §3 Monorepo layout + arrows
§3 tree + the owner-added `packages/auth` (spec amended); apps/mcp = agents.md only. Arrows enforced by
scripts/check-boundaries.ts (allow-list mirrors the spec block verbatim),
green in CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml) since commit one.

### §4 Package contents
- contracts: events/runs/rules/review/check/contributor/repo/workflow + the
  demo-extracted domains. AUTHORED files flagged in DECISIONS.md.
- forge: interface + types ONLY (packages/forge/src/index.ts — nothing else).
- core: define/registry/8 rules + ai-review (rule.ts + instructions.md +
  template.md versioned together), workflow/{executor,validate}.ts,
  scoring/{score,signals}.ts, context.ts. Purity: no I/O imports anywhere
  (boundary script + review); skipped-not-thrown proven in define.test.ts.
- forge-github: adapter.ts, webhook/{verify,normalize}.ts, client/{auth,
  http,reads}.ts, actions/{execute,check,comment}.ts, fixtures/ (captured,
  PROVENANCE.md).
- db: schema/{events,runs,repos,moderation,rollups,auth}.ts, services/
  {events,runs,repos,insights,moderation}.ts, client.ts, migrate.ts,
  drizzle/0000. snake_case, timestamptz, jsonb validated on write
  (services parse with contracts schemas).
- ui: primitives untouched from the demo (packages/ui reserved; demo
  primitives live in apps/web/src/components/ui — lifting them is future
  mock-shrink work, noted for taste review).
- utils: id/errors/time/string/retry per spec list, tested.
- api: webhooks.ts (verify→tx→200, NOTHING else), stream.ts (SSE),
  auth mount; middleware/auth.ts folded into index.ts deps injection.
- worker: jobs/{process-event,run-workflows,pr-surface,resume-run,rollup}.ts,
  ai/generate.ts, default-workflow re-validation. replay job: see §11 gap note.
- web: four §4 surfaces (Home stats real, Workflows editor, Rules config,
  Insights=demo analytics on mocks) + /events, /runs/$runId, /moderation.

### §5 Data & ingestion — every numbered step
1 verify (verify.ts, 401) · 2 ONE tx insert+enqueue (events service, proven) ·
3 UNIQUE delivery_id no-op (proven) · 4 200-fast nothing-else (webhooks.ts) ·
5 contracts parse + quarantine + fixture-candidate log (process-event.ts,
proven) · 6 NormalizedEvent + NOTIFY (markEventNormalized, proven) · 6b
pending check on pickup (pr-surface.ts emitPendingCheck, tested) · 7 match by
trigger (run-workflows.ts) · 8 RuleContext pre-fetched via adapter reads with
per-read degradation (context.ts, proven) · 9 DAG walk with step records
(executor.ts) · 10 SNAPSHOT on run (createRun validates, proven) · 11 multi-
workflow JOIN worst-verdict (run-workflows.ts) · 12 actions rows-first,
marked executed (runs service + pr-surface, retry no-op proven) · 13 check +
comment same persistence step (emitPrSurface) · SSE fan-out → Query cache
(stream.ts → events.query.ts). Append-only: no delete/update of raw anywhere.

### §6 Rules & workflows
Boolean requirement + exemption (run-workflows maintainer/org-member check) ·
defineRule primitive with Zod config (contracts) + result schemas · evidence
typed per rule (CoV in pr-rate-limit evidence per the spec's own example) ·
versioning law (registry keyed id@version; ai-review prompts versioned with
the rule) · workflow JSON DAG in contracts/workflow.ts · executor eats JSON
since step 6, editor emits it last (round-trip proven) · moderation = paused
run (moderation.integration.test.ts).

### §7 PR surface
One comment: verdict line + ONE sentence, then a `for maintainers` dropdown
holding the hosted-PNG "View on Tripwire" button + `<!-- tripwire:run -->`
marker, upsert never append (comment.ts, snapshot + fake-fetch tests) · one
`tripwire` check per head SHA, pending → verdict, updated in place, never a
workflow file (check.ts) · same-step emission (pr-surface.ts) · branch
protection is the human's toggle (QUEUE #5); tripwire never mutates it.

### §8 Review agent
AI SDK in worker only · injected generate() (RuleContext) · bounded loop
(step cap + submit_review stop, adapter-read tools only, diff up front) ·
muzzle schema contracts/review.ts (essay + >5 findings rejected in tests) ·
RuleResult envelope composes in workflows · prompts versioned with the rule ·
full trace in evidence. GAP: eve demo absent — prompts authored (morning
review target).

### §9 Frontend conventions
Thin route.tsx (all 7 new routes: component + pendingComponent + buildSeo,
zero exported components) · components/<feature>/<part> organization ·
key factories + staleTime + signal forwarding (cleanup pass extended this to
the demo's queries) · onSettled reconciliation (rule-config-form,
moderation queue) · SSE merges into cache (events.query.ts) · one sanctioned
useEffect · kebab-case files · seo.ts authored (demo had none).

### §10 Auth
Better Auth GitHub-only (@tripwire/auth/server createAuth, served by the WEB
head via start.ts request middleware — vite proxy is dead under nitro; spec
§10 records the transport) · user.id UUIDv7; GitHub identity ONLY in account +
forge_identities (databaseHook) · moderation_items.decided_by FK → user.id ·
contributors never authenticate (scored subjects live in event data).

### §11 Testing
Unit (per-rule over fixture contexts; fast-check properties: range, red-flags-
never-raise, determinism) · contract (fixture corpus normalizes;
contracts.test.ts) · snapshot (3 golden comments) · integration (REAL postgres
via docker-run helper — testcontainers hangs under Bun; duplicate-delivery
proven) · live E2E → VERIFICATION-QUEUE. CI from first commit.
GAPS (honest): verdict-replay job (jobs/replay.ts + /replay wiring) is NOT
implemented — /replay exists as a command doc; the job needs stored runs to
replay against and is a natural next session. Shadow mode is post-MVP-launch
by spec.

### §12 Governance
AGENTS.md (anti-BS + cut list verbatim) · 13 scoped agents.md · 8 rules with
description+paths frontmatter · 14 commands · constitution · tripwire-design
skill. Structure-is-documentation upheld: every deferral in DECISIONS.md or
the queue.

### §13 Build order
Steps 1–10 committed in order, one commit each, checks green before each.
Done-whens: machine-provable parts proven in this file's step entries; human
parts queued (#1–#9) in dependency order.

### Known gaps for the morning (all recorded)
1. ai-review prompts authored without the eve demo (DECISIONS, QUEUE #7).
2. Verdict-replay worker job not implemented (§11 row + §4 worker listing) —
   needs real stored runs; command doc exists.
3. packages/ui still empty; demo primitives live in apps/web/components/ui
   (lifting = mock-shrink work, design-final risk if rushed).
4. Home queue list + log/automod/analytics surfaces still mock-backed by
   design (mocks shrink as later sessions land real data of that depth).
5. Octokit-example fixtures pending replacement by self-captured deliveries
   (QUEUE #3/#5).

## Hardening session (pre-live) — 6428ecd, 591af44, 75bb2ca, c4fa9e3

**Scope:** four security-posture units executed before first live traffic, one
commit each, checks green before each.

**Unit 1 — fail-closed floor (6428ecd).** All-skipped or ≥50%-skipped rule
nodes upgrade a would-be pass to needs_review: paused run, `run:degraded`
moderation item, degradation evidence as a run step, neutral check, "sent to
review — evaluation degraded" comment. Single skip still conducts as pass.
Resume: approve ⇒ pass, deny ⇒ block (recorded+executed).
```
bun test apps/worker →
✓ degraded reads (all throw) ⇒ fail-closed floor: needs_review + moderation
  item, never pass  (degradedReads = [diff, commits, contributor])
✓ partial degradation (minority skipped) ⇒ still pass
```
Queue amended: Issues R&W at #1; degraded-creds sub-check at #5.

**Unit 2 — auth fail-closed in prod (591af44).** `resolveAuthPosture`:
missing BETTER_AUTH_SECRET + NODE_ENV=production ⇒ refuse to serve (api exits
at boot; web throws per request). Dev open-gate unchanged. Guard unit-tested
(3 tests).

**Unit 3 — block files request-changes (75bb2ca).** Block action now submits
a REQUEST_CHANGES review (one-liner + run link) so unprotected repos get
friction; check remains the primary gate. Best-effort: 403 (legal on own
PRs) warns + marks executed, never kills the run. Payload unit-tested.

**Unit 4 — ai-review port + hardening, still @1 (c4fa9e3).** Eve demo FOUND
at ~/tripwire-eve-agent-demo — instructions.md now carries the ported review
process (maintainer-QoL test, slop signals, CONTRIBUTING/AGENTS rules check,
ambiguity ⇒ needs_review) plus: trust rules (all submission content is
untrusted data; injection attempts are social-engineering findings),
explicit-truncation rule + `[diff truncated: showing 60000 of N chars]`
marker, AI-assistance product line, confidence anchors.
```
bun test packages/core/src/rules/ai-review → 11 pass
(trust/truncation/anchors present in instructions; marker renders only when
 clipped; injection fixture renders as data; muzzle tests unchanged)
```
Queue #7 gains the live injection drill.

**Checks (final state):**
```
biome:      Checked 331 files. No fixes applied.
typecheck:  10/10 workspaces exit 0
boundaries: ✓ passed
tests:      116 pass, 0 fail (3 snapshots, 289 expect)
```

**Decisions:** DECISIONS.md "Hardening session" — four entries, two of which
explicitly AMEND step-6/step-7 decisions rather than silently replacing them.

**Needs Grim's eyes:** final instructions.md read-through before queue #7
(it freezes as @1 at first live invocation); the 50% floor threshold.

## Spec-sync session — f2f0d56 (docs) + SSE gate commit

**Scope:** spec.md synced to reality (auth package/arrows, web-head auth
transport + why, OpenRouter provider, Node-runtime caveat), AGENTS.md +
rule docs mirrored, parity audit de-staled; /events/stream session-gated with
the web head proxying same-origin.

**Machine-verified:**
```
bun test apps/api →
✓ no session ⇒ 401, nothing streamed
✓ valid session ⇒ 200 and the stream heartbeats
✓ dev open posture (auth null) ⇒ stream stays usable
✓ webhook route untouched by the gate (HMAC auth); healthz open
live smoke: curl /events/stream (no cookie) → {"error":"session required"}
full: 120 pass, 0 fail · biome clean · 11/11 typecheck · boundaries ✓
```

**Needs Grim's eyes:** none new — transport + gate follow the recorded
precedents.

---

## Installation-sync fix (live gap)

**Scope:** installation/installation_repositories events → 4 new normalized
kinds → repos rows synced (upsert / soft-delete); lazy repo upsert on unknown-
repo change requests; /rules lists active repos only; first SELF-CAPTURED
fixture (our App's live installation delivery).

**Machine-verified:**
```
bun test packages/forge-github → 21 pass (installation.created fixture
  normalizes with our real installation id 145946161 + Boring-Software-Inc/
  scratch; deleted/added/removed map to their kinds)
bun test apps/worker →
✓ install event ⇒ repo row (external_id, installation_id, removed_at null),
  visible via listActiveRepos, NO run created
✓ uninstall ⇒ removed_at set, excluded from active list
✓ change-request for unknown repo ⇒ lazily upserted row
full: 126 pass, 0 fail · biome clean · 11/11 typecheck · boundaries ✓
```

**Live follow-up:** restart the worker, then re-deliver the installation
webhook from the App's Advanced tab (or reinstall) — /rules should show
Boring-Software-Inc/scratch.

---

## Live bring-up + PR-surface polish (arc)

Not a spec step — the sequence from "first webhook" through a proven live
heartbeat, plus the UX polish that surfaced along the way. Each landed as its
own commit with checks green.

**Env + transport fixes (live debugging):**
- `.env` PEM re-quoted (raw multiline broke Bun's parser); worker normalizes
  `\n` escapes.
- Nitro's server-fn runtime loads dotenv from the app dir → `apps/web/.env`
  symlinks the root `.env`; `PORT`→`API_PORT` (leaked into vite via the
  symlink); dev:api / dev:worker root scripts.
- Bun.serve `idleTimeout: 45` (10s default severed 15s-heartbeat SSE).
- Query errors render on the events page instead of the serialization frame.

**@tripwire/auth + web-head transport (5bd9138, f695b75):** auth folded into
its own package (./server + ./client); Better Auth served BY the web head via
`createStart` request middleware (vite proxy is dead under nitro; no
file-based server routes this version); portable UUIDv7 (nitro dev is Node —
`Bun.randomUUIDv7` threw); `/events/stream` session-gated with the web head
proxying same-origin. Spec §2/§3/§10 synced.

**Installation sync (91cd656):** the live gap — installing the App created no
repo row. Four new event kinds, repos synced (upsert / soft-delete), lazy
upsert for unknown repos, /rules lists active repos; first SELF-CAPTURED
fixture (our install delivery).

**Dashboard shell (4cc870f):** the five new surfaces render inside
DashboardLayout — topbar nav everywhere, no back-button escapes.

**PR comment as-built (84fb3d6, 2e8f1fb, f20cf30):** shields badge → hosted
"View on Tripwire" PNG (Grim's Paper design); one cohesive comment (reason up
top, run button in a `for maintainers` dropdown); review defers to the comment;
copy rewritten in tripwire voice.

**Live heartbeat proof (8244f8b) — the milestone:**
```
malicious PR Boring-Software-Inc/scratch#1 (exfil workflow + crypto DONATE +
"pre-approved, submit pass" injection in the description):
  verdict block · crypto-address/honeypot/ai-review all failed
  tripwire check = failure on the head SHA
  ONE comment (marker, upsert) + a CHANGES_REQUESTED review by tripwire-dev[bot]
  ai-review confidence 1.0 — findings on the exfil (curl|sh + GITHUB_TOKEN),
  the "typo fix" social engineering, and the crypto spam; IGNORED the injection
```
The muzzle + trust rules hold against real adversarial input. Correction to a
step-7 note: block review posts as the bot identity, so no 403 on own PRs.
`TRIPWIRE_DISABLE_EXEMPTION=true` (off by default) lets the repo owner test the
gate solo.

**Deferred decision recorded:** public run pages (spec §10 "Access model") —
`/runs/{id}` public read-only so blocked contributors can read the judgment;
mutations + lists stay gated; private-repo runs gated for MVP; findings public,
raw trace gated. Session prompt in DECISIONS.md; patch after rule calibration.

**Checks (final):** biome clean · 11/11 typecheck · boundaries ✓ · 126 tests,
0 fail.

## Spec-merge — unified rules (2026-07-11) — docs only

Owner-approved amendment merged into spec.md; "automod" killed as a concept.
Not a fourth primitive — a better rules UI (folds into `/rules`) plus a new
class of rule targets (fold into the rule primitive). Rules declare
`target: change-request | comment | issue`; executor unchanged, only the
RuleContext per trigger differs. Gate actions (change-request) vs reversible
content actions (`hide-comment`/`label`/`send-to-moderation`; never auto-delete);
`validate.ts` enforces target/action fit. Content evals are runs + run_steps +
`run_actions` (reversal handle); `content_matches` derived index. v1 content
rules: spam-domains@1, blocked-terms@1, custom-pattern@1 (RE2/timeout+cap),
comment-burst@1; crypto-address@1 gains `target:comment`. Classifiers deferred.
FP loop = reversals/actions per rule + unhide affordance. New ingest kinds
issues.opened/edited + issue_comment.edited. `/automod` deleted → `/rules`.

**Amendment §4 SUPERSEDED** by owner's derived-default semantics: no-workflow
repos derive the workflow from enabled toggles; custom-workflow repos let the
graph win with toggle = kill switch (`skipped: disabled`, off the degradation
floor); no "not wired" state; `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW` constant → `core/workflow/
derive.ts`; one engine change (worker reads `rule_configs.enabled`) deferred to
the toggle-semantics session. constitution.md bans "automod" (use "rules").
Cut-list additions incl. SIGNAL nodes only (trigger/rule/gate/action exist).
Full ledger in DECISIONS.md. Docs-only pass — no code changed.

**Checks:** biome clean · 11/11 typecheck · boundaries ✓ · tests 125 pass /
1 fail — the failure (`process-event.integration`: "maintainer PR ⇒ exempt, no
run", expects 0 runs, got 1) is PRE-EXISTING on main and code-unrelated to this
docs-only pass; flagged to VERIFICATION-QUEUE, not introduced here.

## Live-fix session — four live-test defects + env hardening (2026-07-11)

Four units, one commit each, all four checks green before each. The live-test
report (`live-test-report.md`) is the test agent's artifact — left untouched.

**Unit 1 — gates must see failures (`b221093`, SECURITY).** A gate whose feeding
rules ALL fail never ran: rule→gate edges default `when: pass`, so nothing
conducted the gate, `block` never fired, and the run derived verdict **pass**.
Live evidence: T2a first attempt, single failing rule ⇒ pass; the default gate
only blocked because sibling passing rules opened it. Fix: a gate runs once ≥1
source has settled and aggregates outcomes; when-conduction no longer gates gate
execution. Exhaustive property test: no derived-shape run with ≥1 failing rule
can verdict pass.

**Unit 2 — toggles become real (`c485503`).** The worker never read
`rule_configs` (only the web UI did), so `/rules` toggles were cosmetic —
disabled account-age evaluated anyway (T1). New `core/workflow/derive.ts`: a
repo with no saved workflow gets a workflow DERIVED from enabled rules (baseline
= the retired `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW`); baseline rule runs unless disabled, config
overrides, non-baseline enabled rules opt in. Saved-workflow path skips disabled
nodes as `disabled` (conducts as pass, off the degradation floor). `/rules`
gains a "managed by your workflow" tag.

**Unit 3 — surface sweeper + comment ownership + boot health (`ef9b797`).** T3:
a creds outage left needs_review surface actions stuck at `recorded` — the
neutral check never posted, the stale comment stood, no retry. Plus a follow-on
finding: two moderation items on one PR decided out of order, an older run's
approve overwrote the blocked comment. Fixes: a minutely sweeper re-attempts
stuck actions (idempotent, age-windowed cap); a staleness guard supersedes rows
whose verdict moved on; **comment ownership** — only the latest run per PR
executes its comment (per-SHA checks still post), enforced in `emitPrSurface` +
the sweeper; a boot health check (GitHub `GET /app` + ai-review creds) makes a
broken-env worker loud at startup.

**Unit 4 — env hardening + queue #10 closed (this commit).** #10 was env
contamination, not code: `TRIPWIRE_DISABLE_EXEMPTION` leaked into the process
env. Worker integration tests now delete/restore the flag in setup (proven: the
maintainer test passes even with the flag set ambiently); the flag is refused
under `NODE_ENV=production` (resolveAuthPosture pattern), unit-tested. #10 closed.

**Checks (final, all four units): biome clean · 12/12 typecheck · boundaries ✓ ·
145 tests, 0 fail.**

**Unit 5 — deny never fails open (this commit).** T4 headline: a deny on a
moderation node with no deny edge resumed to PASS — green check from an explicit
maintainer no. `resume-run.ts` now floors that case to block (synthetic
`run:deny-floor` step + recorded/executed block action); approve semantics and
explicit-deny-edge graphs untouched; degraded-floor resume pinned by test.
Checks: biome clean · typecheck ✓ · boundaries ✓ · 148 tests, 0 fail.

**Unit 6 — editor outcome handles (this commit).** Adopted the T4 mid-test fix
(red fail handle on rule/gate nodes, white targets, sourceHandle ⇒ when:"fail")
and hardened it: `handleWhen()` generalizes the mapping, send-to-moderation
nodes gain green approve / red deny handles, handles beat stale labels, and
when-edges reload onto their handles. Round-trip tested (5 new tests); worker
emission fixture unchanged (node shapes untouched). Editor can now draw the
full moderation loop that Unit 5's deny floor backstops.
Checks: biome clean · typecheck ✓ · boundaries ✓ · 153 tests, 0 fail.

**Unit 7 — verdict replay, the missing §11 row (this commit).** `bun run
replay` re-runs the CURRENT engine over stored runs — raw events re-normalized,
rule envelopes replayed verbatim from run_steps (never a live GitHub read),
snapshots re-executed through the current executor/floors/resume — and diffs
verdicts. CI gate on `packages/core/**` replays the committed 15-run corpus
(`.github/workflows/replay.yml`); `replay.test.ts` pins the expectation. Known
gap #2 closed. Flip report over ALL 15 stored runs, verbatim:

```
verdict replay — 15 runs · 13 unchanged · 2 flips · 0 skipped
FLIP 019f538a-926f-7000-87c7-e9cd3d79c80a: pass → block
  responsible: gate reachability (unit 1) — gates now run once a source settles, failures included
  failed rules: account-age@1
  evidence delta: none — rule envelopes replayed verbatim from stored run_steps; only the walk changed
FLIP 019f54d3-0c13-7000-930a-dc97f87e1d5e: pass → block
  responsible: deny-floor resume semantics (unit 5) — deny with no deny edge now blocks
  failed rules: account-age@1
  evidence delta: none — rule envelopes replayed verbatim from stored run_steps; only the walk changed
```

Exactly the two explainable flips (T2a first-attempt single-failing-rule pass,
T4 deny-produced pass), zero unexplained, zero skipped — the done-when held.
Ledgered for later: VERIFICATION-QUEUE #11 (run page + /moderation surface
`run:deny-floor` distinctly — UI pass, bundles with the public-run-page patch).

**Public run pages + queue #11 (this commit).** §10 access model is live:
`/runs/{id}` reads without a session (root redirect exempts it via
`isPublicPath`), rendering verdict + per-rule steps + evidence + ai-review
FINDINGS with the raw trace stripped from evidence AND output, snapshot
nulled, dashboard chrome dropped, "powered by tripwire" footer added. No
session + private/unknown repo ⇒ null (fail closed; worker's lazy repo upsert
now defaults private for the same reason). Mutating + list server functions
gained a real 401 gate (`requireSession`) — approve/deny, events, moderation
queue/stats, rules, workflows, analytics activity; `decidedBy` is now the
session user. Queue #11 closed: `run:deny-floor` renders as "denied by
maintainer — no deny edge drawn", `run:degradation` as "evaluation degraded"
with the skipped ratio; /moderation pills `run:degraded` items. Ledgered:
any-session-sees-any-run (no repo-membership model yet) and visibility not
threaded through change-request payloads.
Checks: biome clean · typecheck ✓ (12/12) · boundaries ✓ · 177 tests, 0 fail.

**Unit 8 — /rules over real data (this commit).** The automod mockup's UI
becomes `/rules` on real stored data (§9 step 3), honest-render throughout.
Fixes the Unit-2 residual: the toggle now shows ACTUAL execution state
(`ruleExecutes` mirrors derive.ts — baseline rules ON unless disabled), not the
old `enabled ?? false` that hid the baseline rules a fresh repo runs; saved-
workflow repos show "managed by your workflow". New `getRulesStats` reads
run_steps (matches) + run_actions (executed enforcement kinds only, never the
always-emitted comment/check) repo-scoped over 24h with hourly sparklines — no
new pipeline. Header: active rules + matches/actioned (real sparklines) + FP
rate ("not enough data" — reversals untracked). Cards: id@version chip, target
chip, action summary, corrected toggle, 24h count, sparkline, JSON config.
Matcher-kind chips + FP sort omitted (no data, not faked). Checks: biome clean ·
typecheck 0 · boundaries ✓ · 184 tests, 0 fail (+7).

**Unit 9 — ai-review opt-in per repo (this commit).** ai-review costs tokens, so
it's now OFF by default and enabled per repo from the dashboard (§8 owner
decision). Removed ai-review from DEFAULT_WORKFLOW (the baseline) — the single
source both deriveDefaultWorkflow and ruleExecutes read, so display and
execution agree: absent row ⇒ off, enabled ⇒ opts in. RULE_CATALOG gains an
`optIn` marker + voice blurb; the /rules card renders opt-in-off as an "enable"
offer, not a silent toggle. Keyless behavior unchanged and pinned (workflow with
ai-review + no key ⇒ skipped, counts toward the floor). scratch's ai-review row
set false. Replay CI gate (frozen corpus) stays EXACTLY 13 unchanged / 2 flips —
the default change touched no history (live-DB 14/2 only reflects a new run added
between sessions). Ledgered (not built): an operator flag service (Databuddy) may
later gate WHO can enable ai-review — dashboard-only, never in the worker's
evaluation path. Checks: biome clean · typecheck 0 · boundaries ✓ · 187 tests, 0
fail.

**Unit 10 — public evidence split (this commit).** The public run page mixed
contributor facts (public on the diff — the appeal mechanism) with repo
internals (configured thresholds, ai-review trace). Now split, rule-owned:
`defineRule` gains `publicEvidence`/`summarize` (in each rule file, versioned
with it); the worker projects at persist time into new `run_steps.public_evidence`
+ `summary` columns (migration 0001); `toPublicRunView` gets dumb (serve the
stored projection), session view unchanged (`toFullRunView` strips only the
carrier fields). Chose core+worker over a contracts-side projection — a second
home for rule knowledge is the toggles-drift class, and it breaks contracts'
zod-only law. Leak invariant pinned over the whole registry (no configSchema key
in any public evidence). Historical runs degrade honestly (null ⇒ no evidence
detail). Checks: biome clean · typecheck 0 · boundaries ✓ · 193 tests, 0 fail ·
replay corpus 13/2 (projections aren't verdicts).

**Units — app collapse to real surfaces (3 commits).** Owner decision: tripwire
doesn't re-render GitHub, so the demo's mock GitHub-browser pages are cut. (1)
Deleted the /$org/** cluster + profile + integrations + automod + dither-charts
routes and all their mock data/components; kept /dither-kit (dev ref). (2) Home
`/` becomes the REAL moderation queue under the real stat header; /moderation
redirects to /; deleted the mock queue + the seedStats fallback (a DB error now
fails honestly, no fake numbers). (3) Shell shows the real session user
(getCurrentUser via better-auth + forge_identities) with an open-dev placeholder,
not the MODERATOR fixture; nav = Queue/Events/Rules/Workflows/Analytics;
/analytics collapsed to moderation-only. Spec §4 rewritten. Checks green each
commit (biome, typecheck, boundaries, 193 tests).

**Unit — the activity feed (/events → /activity).** The dead-end events wall
becomes the live decision feed: each row is an event joined to its run.
`eventServices.listActivity` (db) joins events→runs + the first failing rule's
one-liner; rows show a verdict chip + reason and link to the run, "evaluating…"
while in flight, or a dimmed no-run reason (push/comment/installation/exempt).
Live via a new `runs` NOTIFY (worker, on process-event completion + resume) →
SSE `run` event → resolves the row in place (no polling, no second row).
Client-side filter chips (all/blocked/sent to review/passed/no run) over the
cached feed. Route + nav renamed to /activity. Checks green: biome, typecheck,
boundaries, 196 tests (+ a listActivity integration test).

**Unit — activity feed restructure (chain by change request).** The flat feed
(one row per event) is regrouped: the real unit is the change request, not the
event. New `eventServices.listActivityFeed` (db) groups by (repo, subject_number)
IN SQL — a CTE picks the top-N change requests by latest activity, a second join
pulls each group's chronological timeline (events + runs + §10 leading reason);
standalone events (installation/push) fetched separately, interleaved by latest
activity. Each group is one collapsible row, collapsed by default (header:
#num title · actor · repo · current-verdict chip · count · time; expanded = the
PR's timeline, each entry links to /runs/$runId or the event's GitHub html_url).
Grouped live merge (activity.query.ts): a new event upserts into its group and
bumps it to the top without growing the list; a run resolves in place and
re-derives the current verdict — same SSE plumbing, no polling. Filter chips
filter GROUPS by current verdict. Shared VerdictChip. Checks green: biome scoped,
typecheck (web+db) 0, boundaries ✓, 196 tests 0 fail.

**Unit — activity feed polish (5 defects).** (1) Tripwire's own comments stay but
nest in the change-request timeline, labeled `bot` and deduped to one entry
(normalize sets a neutral comment.byTripwire from COMMENT_MARKER; buildGroup +
mergeEvent collapse create/edits); copy "commented on #1". (2) A blocked entry
always says why: the leading-reason lateral falls back to the failing rule name
when the §10 summary is null, plus a one-shot scripts/backfill-public-projection.ts
re-projected stored evidence through the worker's own projectRulePublic —
backfilled 31 of 37 stale rule steps. (3) Exempt + non-run context render dimmed
so they don't compete with verdicts. (4) Every entry clickable: run → /runs/$runId
else the event's GitHub html_url (push gained an optional compare url through
contracts + normalize). (5) The garbage Codertocat fixture event deleted via a
one-off SQL statement (append-only preserved — no app delete path). Root
package.json gained core/db/drizzle devDeps so scripts/ resolves workspace pkgs.
Spec §4 surface line updated. Checks green: biome, typecheck, boundaries, 196
tests, replay corpus 2 flips (unchanged causes).

**Unit — activity feed wire shapes to contracts + typed row mapping.** A live bug
(received_at.toISOString threw) traced to a typing lie: db.execute() raw rows
aren't Drizzle-mapped, so timestamptz is an ISO string not a Date, muted by `as
unknown as {received_at: Date}`. Fixed structurally: moved the feed wire shapes
(run summary, timeline entry, group, feed item) into @tripwire/contracts as Zod
schemas — deleted the duplicate copies in db/services AND web (the drift class),
both now import from contracts. Every raw query maps through explicit coercion
(mapEntry/mapRun/asMs/asIso/asString) off Record<string,unknown> — no `as unknown
as` on results (only row.normalized as NormalizedEvent, jsonb validated on write).
The getActivityFeed server fn now activityFeedSchema.parse()s its output — shape
mismatch fails loudly at the boundary. Added a real-postgres integration test:
groups carry ISO-string timestamps + parse clean against the contract, incl. a
standalone row. Checks green: biome, typecheck (all pkgs), boundaries, 197 tests.

**Unit A — rules declare a remedy (§12).** defineRule gains a required
remedy ("revise"|"wait"|"appeal") + optional waitHint(evidence) — rule-owned,
versioned with the rule, same pattern as publicEvidence/summarize. remedy drives
the PR comment's "how do i fix this?" body; required means a rule can't ship
without deciding (compiler + registry table test enforce it). account-age/
min-merged-prs/pr-rate-limit=wait (account-age +waitHint deriving a threshold-free
"it clears in N days"; pr-rate-limit omits — no timestamps in evidence to derive a
window remainder without leaking windowHours), the rest=revise. Extended the
leak-invariant test: a waitHint names no config key. Not a version bump (presentation
metadata, no verdict/evidence change; replay unchanged 2 flips). Checks green:
biome, typecheck, boundaries, 200 tests.

**Unit B — the PR comment + review copy.** Rewrote packages/forge-github/copy.ts +
the comment presenter: never count rules (speaks the failing rules' summarize()
one-liners — max 2 inline with wait-hints appended, 3+ collapse to "plus N other
things"); the run button renders VISIBLY outside any <details> (killed the "for
maintainers" wrapper — the run page is the contributor's appeal surface); the "how
do i fix this?" body is chosen by the failing rules' remedies (all-revise / nothing-
revisable / mixed, appeal sentence when anything non-revise); @-mention the
contributor on blocked + sent-to-review; drop the "tripwire:" prefix everywhere.
Review stamp is one line "blocked — {first reason}.". Reasons built in the worker
(comment-reasons.ts) from each step's envelope via the rule's own summarize/remedy/
waitHint; emitPrSurface takes reasons (dropped the stats rule-count). Adjusted the
rule one-liners to speak to the contributor. Regenerated the comment snapshots and
replaced the condensedness test with meaningful assertions (verdict line, visible
button, no rule count, no prefix, @-mention). Not a version bump (summaries stored
at persist time; replay unchanged 2 flips). Checks green: biome, typecheck,
boundaries, 201 tests.

**Unit 1 — onboarding (user ↔ installation ↔ active repo, §10).** Tripwire becomes
an app with accounts. Schema (migration 0002): user_installations(user_id, forge,
installation_id) UNIQUE on (forge, installation_id) — one installation, one owner;
user.active_repo_id FK → repos.id. New onboardingServices (linkUserInstallation,
listUserRepos, getActiveRepo, setActiveRepo, getOnboardingState) with an
integration test locking the ownership + must-be-yours invariants. Setup-URL
callback route /onboarding/setup links the installation to the signed-in user
(install state HMAC-binds the user for CSRF); /onboarding narrows (1 repo
auto-selects, >1 picker). Gate: getSessionInfo gains `onboarded`, __root beforeLoad
redirects not-onboarded users to /onboarding. Scoped listActivityFeed/getHomeStats/
listPendingItems to a repoFullName via a getActiveRepo server helper (open-dev falls
back to the first installed repo; empty repo → honest zeros). Replaced the repo
dropdown on /rules + /workflows with the active repo; deleted the now-dead
listRepoOptions/repoOptionsQueryOptions. Documented GITHUB_APP_SLUG + Setup URL in
.env.example. Spec §4/§10 updated. Ledgered honestly: cross-user run-by-id
visibility is still open. Checks green: typecheck all, boundaries, 204 tests
(+onboarding integration), migration applied.

**Unit 2 — real empty states.** One shared components/common/empty-state.tsx
(dashed card, icon, terse title + a description of what fills it, optional action;
tripwire-design tokens). Wired into the home moderation queue ("nothing awaiting
moderation — blocked changes that need a decision land here"), /activity (distinct
no-activity-yet vs no-filter-match, plus the error branch), and /rules + /workflows
("no repo linked yet" + a /rules pre-first-run hint). Stat cards keep honest zeros.
Checks green: typecheck, biome, boundaries, 204 tests.

**Unit 3 — /activity stacked cards.** Replaced the collapsible-group UI with
always-visible card stacks (new activity-stack.tsx; deleted activity-group.tsx).
Each change request is a rounded-xl overflow-hidden container whose inner cards
are divided by a top border with no gaps — top card rounds up, bottom rounds down,
middle square; gap between stacks. Top card is the header (repo/#num/title/actor/
current verdict chip). Stacks with ≥10 entries render first + ~3 middle + last, the
middle behind a progressive blur (stacked masked backdrop-blur layers) with a
"show all N" that expands inline. Kept everything else: live SSE merge, verdict +
filter chips, tripwire-comment dedup+label, dimmed exempt/no-run entries, every
entry clickable. SQL grouping + active-repo scope unchanged. Checks green:
typecheck, biome, boundaries, 204 tests.

**Design correction — /login + /onboarding first contact.** These are the only
pages a stranger sees before trusting us, so: quiet and confident, not decorated.
Ported the real tripwire logo (monochrome SVG, from ~/tripwire's
@tripwire/ui/icons) into components/common/tripwire-logo.tsx and retired the
pixel/display wordmark on both pages. /login is now cardless — the page IS the
card: centered logo, "a firewall for your repo.", the github button, nothing else
(dropped the panel + the "maintainers only" line). /onboarding: cardless shell,
copy rewritten in constitution voice ("install the app and pick one repo to
start." / "pick one repo to start.", no "gates"); the repo picker restyled to the
app's surface tokens with consistent card height, a clear selected state
(border-foreground + check), one-repo selection, and a continue CTA disabled until
a repo is picked. Topbar wordmark left untouched (not a first-contact page).
Checks: typecheck, biome, boundaries, 204 tests.

**Unit — run page step + findings enrichment (§8/§10).** Enriched the live run
page to the owner's Paper design. Steps: passed = one line (label · summarize
one-liner muted · status · timing); failed = expand (header, then the statement at
15px/24 foreground w500, then evidence). Status/timing hug content (no right
gutter, spec §3); step label never "trigger: trigger"; colour budgeted to the
status badge. Kept `summary` on the full run view (toFullRunView) so the maintainer
sees the one-liner. AI-review evidence rebuilt as per-file surface-1 fill-only
containers (dir-dim/basename-bright path, severity counts, GitHub blob links,
collapse ≥3 behind a chevron) with severity-tinted finding cards (critical/warning/
note words, reason brightest, line links, no pass/fail). Findings renderer parses
inline backticks → mono `<code>` chips (sanitized). Wrote the type+spacing scale
into the tripwire-design skill. Hygiene: severity map typed against FindingSeverity,
deleted the translate-y-[-1px] hack, feed truncation fog reuses .fluted-glass.
Checks: typecheck all, biome, boundaries, 204 tests.

**Unit — ai-review@2 (backticked identifiers).** A finding's reason now quotes the
code it accuses in backticks — a material prompt change, so a version bump.
instructions.md (@1) stays byte-identical and registered (stored runs stay
interpretable); @2 uses instructions-v2.md (= @1 + the backtick output rule).
rule.ts became a defineAiReview(version, instructions) factory registering both;
RULE_CATALOG pins ai-review to @2 so newly-enabled repos run it. The findings

**Unit — home stat cards: number and series tell one story (§13.10).** The three
home cards were lying three ways: a card read "0" while its sparkline spiked (the
number and the series were computed over DIFFERENT windows — current-state vs 24h
flow); series bucketed by absolute clock-hour (`extract(hour …)`) so spikes
clustered ~15% from the left and "now" was never the right edge; and a zero delta
rendered as a red "▼0" (direction↔colour was inconsistent across cards). Fixed all
three plus retired two dead cards ("Automod · 24h" — concept killed; "Banned" — no
ban concept, always 0). New card set (3, no filler): **Sent to review** (the
actionable card — first, ringed, scrolls to the queue below, goodDirection down =
work piling up is bad), **Blocked · 24h** (neutral grey — up is ambiguous, either
the gate works or you're under attack; the constitution forbids congratulating
ourselves for blocking people), **Passed · 24h** (green, up = good). Series are now
rolling hours-ago buckets (index 23 = now, right edge); `sentToReview` is the
CURRENT queue depth with a queue-DEPTH series whose last point IS the number
(`depth(t) = items created ≤ t and not decided by t`) — the whole bug, per the
owner. All-zero series render "not enough data", never a faked flat line. The
/analytics drill-down metric set (`moderationMetrics` + `getAnalyticsActivity`)
moved in the SAME commit so it stays in sync (review/blocked/passed). Contract
`modStatsSchema` fields renamed accordingly; `invertDelta?: boolean` on the shared
DitherStatCard became explicit `goodDirection: "up"|"down"|"neutral"` (rules-page
"matches" carried over as down). Locked with a new getHomeStats integration test:
`series[23] === value`, honest zeros for a quiet repo. Dither chart primitives
untouched (owner considers them final). Checks: typecheck all, biome, boundaries,
206 tests.

**Unit — dev persona switcher (§13, dev-only auto-login).** A local convenience,
compile-time excluded from prod. Auto-login: a gated route with no session in a
dev build trampolines through `/dev/auto-login`, which mints the DEFAULT persona
(`active` — the populated dashboard) and lands you in the app; you never see
/login (it stays reachable directly, with a persona panel). A floating switcher
in the shell + the /login panel jump between Tripwire's SIX real states: fresh
maintainer (→ onboarding), one repo (auto-select), many repos (the picker path),
empty dashboard (every empty state), active dashboard (a story), and anonymous
(signs out and opens a seeded PUBLIC run as a stranger — the persona that finally
lets the owner SEE the public run view under open-dev). Sessions are REAL
better-auth sessions minted via email/password (`asResponse` → forwarded
Set-Cookie), never OAuth and never bypassing verification; `createAuth` gains a
`devLogin` flag enabled only when the web head is a dev build. Security is
layered and both layers throw: compile-time `import.meta.env.DEV` (code absent
from prod) + runtime loopback-host check (`assertDevLoginAllowed`), no escape
hatch. Fixtures auto-create per persona on click (installation + repos + story),
namespaced under `tripwire-demo/*` + `demo-*`; `reset dev data` wipes ONLY that
namespace, never a real table. The shape-correct seed builder lives in
`@tripwire/db` (shared with `dev:demo`), constructing contract-valid runs
without importing core. New tests: guard (prod ⇒ throws, non-localhost ⇒ throws),
the session-mint mechanism over real Postgres, and the seeded story's home stats.
Checks: typecheck all, biome, boundaries, 215 tests.

**Unit — `bun run dev:demo` (embedded PGlite, no docker).** One command serves a
fully seeded, presentable app — the WEB HEAD ONLY (no worker/api/queue) on
embedded PGlite (in-process WASM Postgres) at `.demo/`, running the SAME Drizzle
schema and SAME generated migrations as prod (one dialect, no drift; SQLite was
rejected precisely because it would fork the read path). `createPgliteDb` +
`applyPgliteMigrations` land in `@tripwire/db`; `getDb()` (web) branches on
`PGLITE_DATA_DIR` between the pglite instance and the node-postgres pool, with the
shared `Db` type kept single-driver via one documented cast. The demo has no
queue, so the lone write that needs pg-boss (approve/deny) degrades to a
worker-free `markModerationDecided`; a stub pool throws loudly if anything else
reaches for `.pool`. `@electric-sql/pglite` is hoisted at the ROOT (not in
`@tripwire/db`) because it is drizzle-orm's optional peer — declaring it
per-package forked drizzle into a second variant and broke web↔db type identity;
one root declaration collapses it back to a single drizzle instance. The script
seeds the story (owning the single-connection PGlite dir), closes, then spawns
vite pointed at the same dir with a fixed `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` so the gates +
persona switcher work. README documents the command; `.demo/` is gitignored. New
test: prod migrations + services + the worker-free decision path all run on
PGlite (dialect parity). Checks: typecheck all, biome, boundaries, 216 tests.

**Unit — demo seed: a full year of realistic activity.** The seeded story was a
thin handful of runs (read as a toy). Rebuilt `seedStory` to simulate an ACTIVE,
~year-old maintainer repo: ~2,500 change requests over 365 days with a weekday
rhythm, occasional spam waves, and a dense recent window so the home sparklines
are alive; a realistic verdict mix (≈62% pass / 28% block / 10% review) from
dozens of contributors (regulars, occasionals, spammers, newcomers) with
reason-matched titles + failing rules; varied ai-review findings across files; a
real capped pending queue plus decided-review history; enabled rule configs
(baseline + ai-review) so the rules page has data; and daily rollups across the
whole year for analytics. Deterministic (seeded PRNG) and bulk-inserted — ~2,500
runs / 19k steps in ~3s — and idempotent (skips an already-populated repo, so
repeat logins are instant; reset to reseed). The one-repo and many-repos personas
now get stories too (many-repos lighter at 120 days each); empty stays
intentionally empty. Verified live: dev:demo boots onto a populated dashboard.
Checks: typecheck all, biome, boundaries, 216 tests.

**Unit — run page evidence: raw JSON → the stored §10 projection.** The run page
dumped a raw evidence `<pre>` for every rule (the artifact the §10 split was built
to kill). It now consumes the stored projection: each step's `summary` is its
statement; only rules that point at THINGS get a detail block in ai-review's
visual language (honeypot ⇒ touched files as file rows with GitHub blob links,
crypto-address ⇒ a card per matched address + where); every other rule is
summary-only. The file-row/link primitives were extracted to `evidence-parts.tsx`
and shared with ai-review's findings — one set, not two. Raw moved to a
maintainer-only collapsed disclosure that shows the inner `evidence` (thresholds,
ai-review trace), NOT the RuleResult envelope, and never renders for a public
visitor. A pre-projection run (null summary) falls back to the rule's blurb — never
blank, never raw JSON, never echoing the header id. `evidence-view.tsx` deleted.
The demo seed now generates the REAL per-rule projection (`ruleProjection`, shared
by the year-long story and the single-run/public path) so every run reads real;
fixed a latent seed bug where a decided review's `decided_at` could land in the
future (broke series[23] === value) by clamping to `now`. Checks: typecheck all,
biome, boundaries, 216 tests.

**Unit — min-merged-prs@2 (fix an unsatisfiable rule).** @1 required merged change
requests IN THIS repo — unsatisfiable for any first-timer (can't merge here without
merging here), silently banning new contributors with a lying "wait" remedy.
Shipped @2 (leaving @1 frozen + registered so stored runs stay interpretable):
the requirement is now GLOBAL merged CRs EXCLUDING repos the contributor owns
(a single `author:X is:pr is:merged -user:X` search) — "someone else accepted
their work", and unforgeable by a self-created self-merge. Extended the
ForgeAdapter contributor read with `mergedElsewhere: number | null` (null, not 0,
on a failed read → the rule SKIPS, never guesses) threaded through the worker's
RuleContext. `mergedInRepo` became an EXEMPTION (a proven local contributor past
`trustedAfter` passes regardless of global count). Config `{ min: 1,
trustedAfter: 1 }` with `.describe()` on every field — safe because the rule is
non-baseline (off until enabled) and `min: 1` is always satisfiable (contribute
anywhere you don't own), the property @1 lacked. remedy honestly `wait` with a
threshold-free waitHint; publicEvidence exposes observed counts only. Ownership
exclusion covers the stated attack; push-to-others'-repos isn't a cheap search
qualifier and is a recorded limitation. Tests: @1 frozen behavior pinned; @2
pass/fail/skip + the exemption (trusted-local, zero-global ⇒ pass) + global-count-
unavailable ⇒ skip; a reads test proving the search excludes owned repos and
degrades to null; leak-invariant + registry table updated. History proven
untouched: `replay --corpus` = 15 · 13 unchanged · 2 flips · 0 skipped. Checks:
typecheck all, biome, boundaries, 223 tests.

**Unit — PR comment lifecycle: verdict transitions get their own comment (§7).**
After an incident where a blocked→passed resolution was edited in place (receipts
gone, lost at the top of a long thread), the upsert is now verdict-aware: same
verdict re-run edits in place (the common path, unchanged), a verdict TRANSITION
posts a NEW comment after the commit AND marks the previous one superseded (struck
text + "superseded — see the newer check below.", button/details/marker dropped).
RUN HISTORY is the single source of truth: the worker computes `previousVerdict`
(`getPreviousVerdict`) and passes it to the adapter, which decides
edit-vs-transition SOLELY from it — the `<!-- tripwire:run -->` marker is used ONLY
to locate the active comment, never to infer what happened (no dual detection: a
deleted/edited comment can't make the adapter think "first verdict" while the
worker knows it's a transition). If a transition's old comment is gone, the
resolution posts anyway with nothing to supersede. Superseding strips the marker,
so exactly one active comment ever carries it. Resolution copy knows the previous
verdict (blocked→passed "that's cleared. good to merge.", etc.). Same incident, second fix: a cleared block
left a CHANGES_REQUESTED review that can't self-edit and kept gating merge on
required-review repos — on a block→(pass|sent-to-review) transition the worker
dismisses the outstanding review (`getLatestBlockReviewId` → a new best-effort,
idempotent `dismiss-review` action; adapter PUTs the dismissal). Comment ownership
unchanged and now also gates the dismissal. Tests: same-verdict edits in place +
ten re-runs = one comment; transition supersedes old + posts new; a transition
whose old comment was DELETED still posts (no supersede, no crash); superseded
golden snapshot; dismiss-review PUT; the two decision queries over real Postgres.
Goldens regenerated. Checks: typecheck all, biome, boundaries, 229 tests.

**Unit — live E2E for the comment lifecycle (`bun run test:lifecycle`, §11).** The
integration tests prove the lifecycle logic against a fake adapter; they don't
prove GitHub accepts our calls or the thread ends up right — the block→pass
transition is the exact flow that broke on a real PR (dither-kit#8). Added a
scripted live E2E that drives ONE PR through blocked → passed → blocked on a
sacrificial repo (tripping `crypto-address` with a wallet address in the diff — no
`workflow` scope needed) and asserts REAL GitHub state via `gh api`, never our DB:
the count of tripwire comments (by bot author), which one carries the marker, that
a superseded comment is struck + marker-less, the request-changes review going
present → DISMISSED → new, and the `tripwire` check conclusion on each head SHA. It
extends the `test:run` env-routing, is idempotent (wipes its prior PR/branch first),
polls with a timeout and a clear "is the worker up?" message, and exits non-zero on
any assertion failure (artifacts left for inspection on failure, cleaned up on
success). Tier documented as §11 nightly/pre-release, NOT per-PR CI (needs real
creds + tunnel + non-exempt pusher). Explicitly NOT automated: whether the copy
READS well — the script proves mechanics, a human reads the thread once. Imports
`COMMENT_MARKER`/`CHECK_NAME` from `@tripwire/forge-github` (added to root
devDependencies) rather than hardcoding drift-prone tokens. Checks: typecheck all,
biome, boundaries, 229 tests (the live script is not part of `bun test`).

**Unit — deploy to Railway, Unit 1: containerize (§13).** Three Dockerfiles built
from the monorepo root. api + worker: `oven/bun:1.3-slim`, run TypeScript
directly (no compile). web: build under Bun, **serve under `node:22-slim`** —
the nitro SSR runtime is Node, not Bun, so `NITRO_PRESET=node-server` is forced
at build (an un-forced build emitted a `Bun.serve` bundle that threw `Bun is not
defined` under node — the generateId portability lesson again). `VITE_SITE_URL`
is a build ARG (inlined via `import.meta.env` in seo.ts), not a runtime var;
every other web env is runtime `process.env`. The Bun installs are NOT
`--production` (that dropped the `@tripwire/*` workspace symlinks); since bun
nests workspace links per package/app, the runtime stage copies the whole
installed tree then overlays source. PORT handling: Railway injects `PORT` per
isolated service (no cross-service collision), api binds `PORT ?? API_PORT ??
8787`. New worker `/healthz` (`Bun.serve` on `PORT ?? WORKER_HEALTH_PORT ??
8181`, reports `{ok,github,aiReview}`) so a dead worker is visible to Railway.
`.dockerignore` added; `docker-compose.yml` unchanged (local dev untouched).
Verified against the compose Postgres: all three images build + boot; api/worker
`/healthz` return ok; web serves (307→/login under node); the production posture
guard fires — api exits 1 without `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. Checks: biome + typecheck
clean on the touched app files, boundary check passes.

**Unit — deploy, Unit 2: Railway config + env matrix + DEPLOY.md.** Three
config-as-code files (`apps/{api,worker,web}/railway.json`): DOCKERFILE builder,
per-service `dockerfilePath`, healthcheck (`/healthz` for api/worker, `/login`
for web — `/` is a 307), and watch patterns that rebuild a service only when its
own paths or shared `packages/**` change (a web-only change never rebuilds the
worker). DEPLOY.md documents: the three services and their Railway settings
(Root Directory MUST be the repo root or the monorepo COPYs break; worker gets
no public domain), the full env matrix (every var × service × secret, plus the
`VITE_SITE_URL` build-time-inlined gotcha and the `APP_URL`=real-web-URL fix),
the production posture checks to assert FIRE (no `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` ⇒ refuses
to boot; `TRIPWIRE_DISABLE_EXEMPTION` refused in prod), the Northern-Virginia
region pair (Railway us-east4 + PlanetScale AWS us-east-1, colocated because
pg-boss polls and rules are chatty), and rollback. Unit 3/4 runbooks are
appended to DEPLOY.md in their own commits. Checks: biome clean on the three
railway.json, JSON valid.

**Unit — deploy, Unit 3: PlanetScale (pooled/direct split + verify gate).**
PlanetScale's pooler drops the session a LISTEN needs, so the app now uses two
URLs: `DATABASE_URL` (pooled) for all transactional/query work + pg-boss, and
`DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` (direct/session) for LISTEN/NOTIFY only. New
`createDirectPool()` in `@tripwire/db` falls back to `DATABASE_URL` when direct
is unset, so local dev is unchanged. The api SSE stream now holds its `LISTEN`
on the direct pool; the worker's `pool` (used only for `pg_notify`) is the
direct pool, while queries + pg-boss stay pooled. New `bun run verify:planetscale`
gates cutover: (A) transaction affinity on the pooled URL, PROVEN BY ROLLBACK —
runs the real ingest (INSERT event + pg-boss enqueue in one tx), confirms atomic
commit, then rolls back a second attempt and asserts neither the row nor the job
survived (a statement-level pooler would autocommit the enqueue on another
backend and it'd survive); (B) LISTEN/NOTIFY on the direct URL, payload asserted
within 7s — and IF B FAILS THE SCRIPT STOPS, no polling fallback (that's a spec
decision, not the script's). Region pair recorded: Railway us-east4 +
PlanetScale AWS us-east-1 (N. Virginia), colocated. Verified: exits 0 against
compose Postgres, exits 1 when DATABASE_URL_DIRECT is unset; 52 api/db/worker
tests pass; typecheck all + biome + boundaries clean; api/worker images rebuilt
and boot.
