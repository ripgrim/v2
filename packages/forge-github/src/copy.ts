 * to review; never rejected/denied/failed; terse, lowercase-friendly, zero
 * exclamation marks). Lives in the GitHub adapter because that is who renders
 * it; when a second forge adapter lands, lift the forge-neutral pieces to a
 * shared home (DECISIONS.md). Structural tokens (the `<!-- tripwire:run -->`
 * marker, the badge path) stay with the presenters — they are not copy.
 *
 * The comment NEVER counts rules ("tripped 1 of 8") — a stranger can't read
 * that. It speaks the failing rules' plain-English reasons and, for a wait-rule,
 * when it clears. The "tripwire:" prefix is gone everywhere — the bot name
 * already carries it.
