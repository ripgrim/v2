 *   if it's gone (a human deleted it), post a fresh one. Ten broken pushes are

 * - a TRANSITION ⇒ post a NEW comment after the contributor's commit, and
 *   supersede the old one IF it's still there. If the old comment was deleted or
 *   edited away, there is nothing to supersede — post the resolution anyway
 *   (run history knows it's a transition), never silently a "first verdict".
