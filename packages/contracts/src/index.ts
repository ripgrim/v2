/**
 * @tripwire/contracts — the shared language.
 *
 * Zod schemas + inferred types, extracted from the redesign demo's mock data.
 * The demo's shapes are the contract; the backend's job is to satisfy them.
 * No functions, no I/O, no deps except zod.
 *
 * Files follow the spec §4 ontology (runs, rules, contributor, repo, insights,
 * moderation). The remaining §4 contracts (events, review, workflow, check)
 * land with the build steps that produce their shapes — see DECISIONS.md.
