/**
 * THE auditable mutation-surface classification (§4, amendment). Every server

 * each fn's middleware chain matches its class:
 *
 *   public — bare createServerFn; session-less or self-gating by design.
 *   authed — accessGuardMiddleware only (approved session; no org context).
 *   member — accessGuard + orgMemberMiddleware (org-scoped read).
 *   admin  — accessGuard + orgAdminMiddleware (org-scoped mutation).
 *   staff  — accessGuard + platformAdminMiddleware (/admin portal; platform
 *            role on the user row, NOT org membership; denial is always 404).
