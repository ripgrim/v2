 * The GitHub App **Setup URL** callback (§10) — the path is an external
 * contract (configured in the App settings), so it keeps its /onboarding/setup
 * address even though user-onboarding is gone. GitHub redirects here with
 * `?installation_id=…&setup_action=…&state=…`. NOTHING is claimed here:
 * a valid state renders the CONFIRMATION naming both sides ("GitHub org X →
 * Tripwire org Y") with a change option; a missing/invalid state renders the
 * CLAIM screen with an org picker. Never auto-attach on a guess.
