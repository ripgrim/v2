/**
 * §4 arm-time backfill. When a repo is armed, replay its STORED change-request
 * events through the REAL engine so the dashboard has history the moment they
 * arm — real runs, `surface: false` so nothing comments/checks on historical
 * change requests (that would be a bot storm on old threads).
 *
 * Bounded on purpose: only the last N days, capped, and paced. The events are
 * stored, but each RuleContext still needs forge reads (diff, contributor), so
 * this is a burst of GitHub API calls on ONE repo — sequential + a delay keeps
 * it well under an installation's rate limit. A failed read degrades that one
 * run (the fail-closed floor already handles it), never the whole backfill.
